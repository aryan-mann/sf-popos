# SF POPOs React App
This is a single page app that shows most of San Francisco's privately-owned public open spaces. The data I used is available **[here](https://www.spur.org/sites/default/files/migrated/anchors/popos-guide.pdf)** from **[spur.org](http://www.spur.org)**

### Credits
I altered **[@tsaiDavid](https://github.com/tsaiDavid)'s [Simple Redux Boilerplate](https://github.com/tsaiDavid/simple-redux-boilerplate/tree/react-router-redux)** by taking out the redux part of it with the help of **[@claudiuandrei](https://github.com/claudiuandrei)**
